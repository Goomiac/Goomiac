ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Goomiac (aka Giacomo).
I'm interested in programming since I had my first PC with an internet connection many, many years ago.
I did play with HTML, PHP and MySQL at the time, Turbo Pascal and some C++.
More recentely I explored the world of game developing with Unity and C#.
Lately I started learning a bit of Python and I'm currently following the Odin Project to learn web development again.
